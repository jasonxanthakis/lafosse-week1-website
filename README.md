# La Fosse Week 1 Website - J&H Video Streaming Service

This is the Video Streaming Service developed by the pairing of Jason and Hassan as part of Week 1 of La Fosse Academy's 9 week training (30/06/2025-29/08/2025).

## What this project does
This video streaming website was designed on Figma, following a brief 'Crazy 8' design brainstorm session. 
As of latest, the website consists of: a homepage, containing carousels displaying a selection of videos; and an account page, containing account details, profile image and an image of the selected payment method.

## Tools and languages used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap V5
- git
- VS code
- Figma

## Future Ideas for Expansion & Further Development
- Add licensing, terms and conditions, etc...
- Have individual videos expand to have their own page when clicked
- Give the genre and search buttons actual functionality
*Note: This is NOT happening BTW

## Collaborators
- Jason Xanthakis
- Hassan Kambala
